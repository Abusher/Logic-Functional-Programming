Prolog Samples
==============

This project is made for collaborating on Prolog language projects that should be completed during a functional programing course in Lviv National University.

Genealogy
---------

**engine** directory has modules that contain procedures witch should work with data that is located in the data files located at the **genealogy** directory. `engine/main.pl` contains the most common and important procedures, while the other modules have some specific stuff.
To successfully run an app with your own datasource, use `engine/main.pl` and other modules in your datasource file. Make sure to disable some predicates when adding more than one module, because there is a lot of intersecting stuff. 

`demo.pl` and `demo2.pl` have a dummy-data with fictional people.

State Tasks
-----------

The `stateTasks` directory contains the solution for the state puzzles like **Monkey & banana** and **Wolf, goat, cabbage**.
